Build a new Flask application that accepts a form submission and presents the submitted data on a results page.

The goal is to help you get familiar with sending POST requests through a form and displaying that information. Consider the below example as a guide.<br>

When you build this, please make sure that your program meets the following criteria:

<li>http://localhost:5000 - have this display a nice looking HTML form.  The form should be submitted to '/process'</li><br>

<li>Save form data into session.</li><br>

<li>http://localhost:5000/result - have this display a html with the information that was submitted by POST</li><br>

<b>Don't forget that any inputs we want to be able to access from the form submission need to have a name!</b><br>

It's always a good idea to print request.form to see if the form is delivering all the information you need in your routing method.<br>
